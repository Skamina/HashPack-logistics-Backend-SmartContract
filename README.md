# Hashpack Logistics Backend Smart Contract

![Hashpack Logistics](79075.jpg)
## Track: DLT for Operations
## The Problem

Africa’s logistics sector is broken. Customers face unreliable deliveries, no real-time tracking, fraudulent riders, and frequent package losses. SMEs and informal vendors struggle with last-mile logistics, hurting their businesses and limiting access to markets.

In rural and peri-urban areas, delivery services are almost non-existent, leaving millions without access to fast, secure, and affordable logistics infrastructure. This inefficiency not only stifles trade but also erodes trust in commerce across the continent.

## Our Solution: Hashpack Logistics

Hashpack Logistics is the first Africa-focused logistics and commerce platform built with transparency and scalability at its core. We combine mobile-first applications, smart rider coordination, and Hedera’s distributed ledger technology to deliver trusted, trackable, and efficient logistics.

![Mobile-first Apps](79082.jpg)

- **Mobile-first apps:** Customers book deliveries in seconds, riders get optimized routes, and vendors manage orders from one dashboard.

![DLT-powered Trust](79060.jpg)

- **DLT-powered trust:** Every pickup, transit, and delivery event is immutably logged on Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), ensuring tamper-proof proof-of-delivery.

![Tokenized Incentives](83670.jpg)

- **Tokenized incentives:** Riders and customers earn rewards through Hedera Token Service (HTS), building loyalty and ensuring fair rider compensation.

- **Vendor-ready APIs:** SMEs and e-commerce shops can integrate Hashpack directly, powering sales with reliable fulfillment.

![Marketplace](79039.jpg)

- **Marketplace:** A built-in marketplace for small businesses, companies, and enterprises to list products, connect to customers, and fulfill orders seamlessly through Hashpack's rider network.

Whether you’re an online vendor in Abuja or a farmer in Kano sending products, Hashpack ensures your package is tracked, verified, and delivered transparently.

## Competitor Comparison

- **Conventional logistics players** (Jumia Logistics, GIG, Max.ng) are limited by centralization and lack of trust mechanisms. They offer delivery but not verifiable proof-of-delivery.
- **Blockchain supply chain projects** (e.g., VeChain, IBM Blockchain) are expensive and designed for global corporates, not Africa’s fragmented SMEs.
- **Community courier apps** provide flexibility but lack accountability, often resulting in fraud or undelivered packages.
- **Hashpack Logistics** bridges this gap by combining rider networks with decentralized trust. Our Hedera-backed model ensures transparency for every stakeholder, from riders to customers to vendors.

## Impact Projection

If scaled continent-wide, Hashpack could:

- Enable millions of SMEs to access reliable, verifiable delivery services.
- Reduce fraud and package theft with tamper-proof proof-of-delivery.
- Generate new income streams for riders through fair tokenized incentives.
- Unlock cross-border trade opportunities with trusted delivery audit trails.
- Strengthen local economies by connecting SMEs and enterprises directly to customers through the marketplace.

## Why We Chose Hedera

- **HCS for Proof-of-Delivery:** Logs events immutably, ensuring full transparency.
- **HTS for Incentives:** Rewards riders/customers with tokens that can be redeemed or traded.
- **Low fees & speed:** Transactions settle in seconds for a fraction of a cent, making it affordable at scale.
- **Energy efficiency:** Hedera’s eco-friendly model aligns with sustainable logistics goals.
- **Enterprise governance:** A globally trusted council secures the network, ensuring long-term stability.

## Why Hashpack, Why Now

- **First-of-its-kind:** No other African delivery platform combines decentralized proof-of-delivery with tokenized rider and customer incentives.
- **Massive market opportunity:** Africa’s logistics market is worth billions but remains underserved and fragmented.
- **SME empowerment:** By solving last-mile delivery trust, Hashpack unlocks e-commerce growth for millions of small businesses.
- **Scalable vision:** From cities to villages, our hybrid model works across Africa’s unique logistics landscape.
- HashPack Logistics Ltd is not just another build, we are a fully registered Private Limited Liability Company.
We hold a Certificate of Incorporation from the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)
Reg No: 8743740, with our Memorandum and Articles of Association (MEMART) and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) issued by the Joint Tax Board (FIRS), we as well secured Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML) Certificate, Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) is the last secured.

We are also in the process of securing additional compliance certifications, such as:
Goods-In-Transit (GIT) Insurance and
other relevant industry licenses (e.g., NIPOST Courier & Logistics License).

 This is the perfect time to build Africa’s trusted logistics.



## ASK:
We’re seeking $200,000 in grant funding to scale our logistics MVP and expand operations to more cities and vehicles from inception.
The funds will be allocated toward platform upgrades, user experience improvements, and, most importantly, launching pilot operations to validate and optimize our model in real-world conditions.

PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT PHASES
