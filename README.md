# Hashpack Logistics Backend Smart Contract

![Hashpack Logistics](79075.jpg)
## Track: DLT for Operations
## The Problem

Africa’s logistics sector is broken. Customers face unreliable deliveries, no real-time tracking, fraudulent riders, and frequent package losses. SMEs and informal vendors struggle with last-mile logistics, hurting their businesses and limiting access to markets.

In rural and peri-urban areas, delivery services are almost non-existent, leaving millions without access to fast, secure, and affordable logistics infrastructure. This inefficiency not only stifles trade but also erodes trust in commerce across the continent.

## Our Solution: Hashpack Logistics

Hashpack Logistics is the first Africa-focused logistics and commerce platform built with transparency and scalability at its core. We combine mobile-first applications, smart rider coordination, and Hedera’s distributed ledger technology to deliver trusted, trackable, and efficient logistics.

![Mobile-first Apps](79082.jpg)

- **Mobile-first apps:** Customers book deliveries in seconds, riders get optimized routes, and vendors manage orders from one dashboard.

![DLT-powered Trust](79060.jpg)

- **DLT-powered trust:** Every pickup, transit, and delivery event is immutably logged on Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), ensuring tamper-proof proof-of-delivery.

![Tokenized Incentives](83670.jpg)

- **Tokenized incentives:** Riders and customers earn rewards through Hedera Token Service (HTS), building loyalty and ensuring fair rider compensation.

- **Vendor-ready APIs:** SMEs and e-commerce shops can integrate Hashpack directly, powering sales with reliable fulfillment.

![Marketplace](79039.jpg)

- **Marketplace:** A built-in marketplace for small businesses, companies, and enterprises to list products, connect to customers, and fulfill orders seamlessly through Hashpack's rider network.

Whether you’re an online vendor in Abuja or a farmer in Kano sending products, Hashpack ensures your package is tracked, verified, and delivered transparently.

## Competitor Comparison

- **Conventional logistics players** (Jumia Logistics, GIG, Max.ng) are limited by centralization and lack of trust mechanisms. They offer delivery but not verifiable proof-of-delivery.
- **Blockchain supply chain projects** (e.g., VeChain, IBM Blockchain) are expensive and designed for global corporates, not Africa’s fragmented SMEs.
- **Community courier apps** provide flexibility but lack accountability, often resulting in fraud or undelivered packages.
- **Hashpack Logistics** bridges this gap by combining rider networks with decentralized trust. Our Hedera-backed model ensures transparency for every stakeholder, from riders to customers to vendors.

## Impact Projection

If scaled continent-wide, Hashpack could:

- Enable millions of SMEs to access reliable, verifiable delivery services.
- Reduce fraud and package theft with tamper-proof proof-of-delivery.
- Generate new income streams for riders through fair tokenized incentives.
- Unlock cross-border trade opportunities with trusted delivery audit trails.
- Strengthen local economies by connecting SMEs and enterprises directly to customers through the marketplace.

## Why We Chose Hedera

- **HCS for Proof-of-Delivery:** Logs events immutably, ensuring full transparency.
- **HTS for Incentives:** Rewards riders/customers with tokens that can be redeemed or traded.
- **Low fees & speed:** Transactions settle in seconds for a fraction of a cent, making it affordable at scale.
- **Energy efficiency:** Hedera’s eco-friendly model aligns with sustainable logistics goals.
- **Enterprise governance:** A globally trusted council secures the network, ensuring long-term stability.

## Why Hashpack, Why Now

- **First-of-its-kind:** No other African delivery platform combines decentralized proof-of-delivery with tokenized rider and customer incentives.
- **Massive market opportunity:** Africa’s logistics market is worth billions but remains underserved and fragmented.
- **SME empowerment:** By solving last-mile delivery trust, Hashpack unlocks e-commerce growth for millions of small businesses.
- **Scalable vision:** From cities to villages, our hybrid model works across Africa’s unique logistics landscape.

## Vision

Hashpack Logistics is not just another delivery app — it is a movement to create Africa’s first decentralized, transparent logistics and commerce network.

Our vision is to make fast, affordable, and tamper-proof deliveries accessible to every African, whether they are in urban centers or rural communities, and to become the continent’s backbone for trusted commerce.
